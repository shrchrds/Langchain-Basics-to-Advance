I\\'m\\nyour host, Jon Krohn. This is an In Case You Missed It\\nepisode that highlights the best parts of conversations we\\nhad on the show in the last month. This first clip you\\'ll\\nhear is from my interview with Dr. Jason Yosinski, one of\\nmy all-time favorite AI researchers. We had a great\\nconversation about making your AI and ML models\\nattractive to customers.\\n00:40 In this clip, I got him to speak from his experience as\\nCEO of the climate technology startup he founded,\\nWindscape AI. This is a great case study if you\\'re\\nplanning to launch your own AI models commercially.\\n00:51 I\\'m sure that kind of engineering mindset is applicable to\\na lot of our listeners, and it seems like your approach is\\nworking. So EDP, a large Portuguese utility company,\\nrecently selected Windscape as one of nine startups for its\\nrenewable innovation program in Singapore to accelerate\\nthe global energy transition. What opportunities do you\\nsee emerging from Windscape AI\\'s participation in this\\nprogram?\\nJason: 01:16 Yeah. Well, thanks for mentioning that. We did apply for\\nthis program. We were selected. EDP is a huge utility. I\\nbelieve they\\'re the fourth-largest wind owner in the world.\\nSo they own tons and tons of turbines. They generate a\\nlot of wind energy. When I met with folks from EDP, I\\nfound them to be a very forward-looking organization.\\nSometimes you get a big company and they\\'re impossibly\\nslow or something, but these folks are really pushing the\\nboundaries, all the boundaries they can, which I thought\\nwas super cool.\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 3\\n01:50 What we hope to get out of it and where that collaboration\\nmight go is to pilot our technology, start working with\\nthem, see how it works on their wind farms around the\\nworld. And then if it does work really well, hopefully we\\nroll out more broadly and we can also maybe use that as\\na demo for new potential customers.\\nJon: 02:08 Very cool. So it sounds like EDP is forward-looking. But\\nin general, do you counter resistance or hurdles as you\\ntry to come to energy utilities and say, \"Hey, you could be\\nusing AI like Windscape\\'s to be improving the efficiency of\\nyour systems.\" Do you encounter resistance or hurdles,\\nor is it relatively straightforward to convince people that\\nyou\\'re doing something valuable?\\nJason: 02:31 I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s straightforward. No. Convincing people\\nthat what you\\'re doing is valuable is maybe always hard. I\\nwould say saying the words AI or machine learning\\ndoesn\\'t immediately open all the doors. It can open some\\ndoors. Some of these companies realize that AI might be\\nrevolutionizing things that happen internally, and they\\'re\\nnot quite sure how yet, but maybe we should talk to these\\nrandos from Windscape and see what they think.\\n02:59 It does open some doors, but not all. Just as probably\\nwithin any industry, there are some organizations that\\nare very forward-looking and others early adopters of any\\ntechnology and others that are slower, that are later\\nadopters. They literally, some have told us, \"We don\\'t care\\nwhat you\\'re [inaudible 00:03:17], just show us when four\\nother companies are using it and then we\\'ll consider\\nusing it because how we work,\" which is potentially an\\nefficient choice from their perspective.\\n03:27 There\\'s also small energy companies and large energy\\ncompanies, and there\\'s a spectrum there of how you sell\\nto these companies and how you get adoption and so on.\\nSo yeah, and convincing everyone, it can be hard. You\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 4\\nhave to convince people that your technology will work,\\nthat it won\\'t be a huge headache to adopt. The people in\\nthe field need to buy into it. It can\\'t ruin their workflow or\\nsomething. It has to be possible to actually integrate. So\\nsome of these systems run software that\\'s hard to work\\nwith and simply integrating can be difficult at times. So I\\ndon\\'t know, there\\'s a lot of factors probably as in any\\nindustry.\\nJon: 04:10 Yeah, it makes so much sense. And hopefully I\\'m not\\ngoing too deep here, and if I am asking a question that\\nwould give away some kind of IP, just feel free to not\\nanswer this. But it seems to me like in a situation like\\nyours, where you are providing software to hardware\\ncompanies, say the turbine manufacturers, you are not,\\nat least in the immediate term, planning on building, say\\nyour own turbines, your own wind farms.\\n04:37 You are a software company. You need to be partnering\\nwith turbine manufacturers, with wind farm operators.\\nHow does that work? Are people... I guess maybe your\\nresponse is going to be similar, where there\\'s a range of\\nresponses where some turbine manufacturers are\\nrelatively early adopters. They see the potential. They say,\\n\"Wow, Jason\\'s done a lot of amazing research in the past.\\nHe seems like the kind of person we should be working\\nwith to accelerate our roadmap.\" And then other folks are\\njust like, \"Yeah, we\\'ve got our own team,\" or I don\\'t know.\\nHow does it look for you? Yeah.\\nJason: 05:09 What we started this whole endeavor, what we imagined\\nwould happen is we would first build products that we\\nwould sell to people that own the turbines. Why do they\\nwant them? Because our product would help them make\\nmore money starting next month. We help them make\\nmore money. They like our product, we roll out, they tell\\ntheir friends. We deploy to more and more farms, more\\nand more companies. As we start to increase our market\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 5\\npenetration in the industry, then much later, turbine\\nmanufacturers would notice and they would say, \"Hey,\\neveryone\\'s using these Windscape people. Maybe we\\nshould talk to them and consider integrating their thing\\noff the factory floor rather than an as aftermarket add-on\\non.\"\\n05:48 That\\'s still the process we\\'re following, although we\\'ve\\nbeen surprised that some OEMs are interested in chatting\\nearly. I think they just want to have on their radar what\\'s\\ngoing on in the world. And if there\\'s any promising\\ntechnology, they want to be there first. So I guess we\\'re\\nalready having some of those conversations too.\\nJon: 06:05 And now, we move from offers that tech companies can\\nrefuse to regulations that startups have a duty to follow.\\nIn this clip with the systems engineering and AI\\nregulation guru, Dr. Gina Guillaume-Joseph, she lays out\\nthe evolving regulatory field for AI, which can be difficult\\nto navigate even if you\\'ve got the best of intentions.\\nSpecifically, Gina and I talk about the AI Bill of Rights,\\nthe NIST AI regulatory framework, and her work on the\\nMITRE ATLAS.\\n06:32 Explain for us... You mentioned there, so there\\'s the NIST\\nAI risk management framework. So NIST is the National\\nInstitutes of Science and Technology, that may be familiar\\nas an acronym. The NIST thing is something for those of\\nus who have done any deep learning to kind of Hello\\nworld deep learning example involves this handwritten\\ndata set of digits. So it\\'s 60,000 handwritten digits done\\nby, if I remember correctly, US postal workers, as well as\\nelementary school students. And so it\\'s just each image is\\na different digit. So it\\'s some of them are zero, some are\\none, some are two, some are threes, all the way up to\\nnine. And this handwritten dataset was curated initially, I\\nguess in the \\'90s, maybe even in the \\'80s by NIST.\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 6\\n07:24 And then Yann Le Cun, who\\'s one of the most famous AI\\nresearchers of all time, he modified with his research\\nteam at the time, I believe they were AT&T Bell Labs, they\\nmodified that NIST handwritten digit dataset to create the\\nMNIST, modified NIST, handwritten dataset. So I don\\'t\\nknow, it\\'s a bit of an aside, but that MNIST dataset is\\nprobably familiar to anyone who\\'s done any kind of deep\\nlearning at all. And so yeah, so that same organization,\\nNIST, has been around for a long time in the US I don\\'t\\nknow how many decades.\\n07:58 But has been trying to set up frameworks for all different\\nkinds of industries in science and technology, and has\\nnow created this AI risk management framework, which\\nagain, I\\'ll have a link to that in the show notes alongside\\nthe AI Bill of Rights. A third framework, I guess, you can\\ncorrect me if I\\'m not using the right word there, that you\\nbrought up in your talk that also seems really helpful\\nhere is something called the MITRE ATLAS.\\n08:26 So I\\'ve been trying to, as you\\'ve been speaking, dig up\\nwhat MITRE stands for, M-I-T-R-E. It doesn\\'t seem like it\\nstands for anything. Can you tell us a bit about MITRE\\nand the MITRE ATLAS and then maybe you can weave\\ntogether these three different things; the AI Bill of Rights,\\nthe NIST AI regulatory framework, as well as MITRE\\nATLAS. And tell us how we can integrate these three\\nframeworks together in order to have a good sense of how\\nto move forward with the AI systems that we built.\\nGina: 08:58 So MITRE is a not-for-profit organization. I worked for\\nthem for 10 years, and they support the federal\\ngovernment across all the federal government agencies to\\nhelp them solve some of the most pressing challenges. So\\nMITRE operates federally funded research and\\ndevelopment centers in support of the federal government\\nto solve problems for a safer world, essentially is what\\nMITRE does. And while at MITRE, I supported multiple\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 7\\nagencies; Department of Homeland Security, Social\\nSecurity Administration, Veterans Affairs, Department of\\nDefense, in some of the challenges that they were facing\\nat the time.\\n09:45 Societal challenges to include when the economy was\\ndoing some downward slides and banks were failing, part\\nof some of the work that I did was at the FDIC, that was\\nwith Booz Allen. But MITRE was involved in other aspects\\nof that as well, to really understand the failures and to\\nfigure out the mitigation strategies to ensure that society\\ndidn\\'t feel those impacts as broadly and as strongly.\\n10:24 And MITRE created the ATLAS threat model introduction,\\nthreat model. It\\'s this comprehensive coverage of AIspecific adversary tactics techniques that includes realworld observation and reporting. It talks about\\naccessibility and usability of AI alignment with existing\\ncybersecurity frameworks in terms of from an AI\\nperspective. And that community engagement\\ncontribution and the educational resources and training.\\n10:58 So they\\'re developing a detailed taxonomy of tactics, of\\ntechniques, of procedures specific to AI systems that\\ncover the entire lifecycle from data collection to model\\ndevelopment and deployment and maintenance. Where\\nthey establish those mechanisms for continuously\\ngathering and updating threat intelligence based on realworld cybersecurity incidents involving AI so that the\\nknowledge base remains current and relevant. So that\\'s\\nwhat MITRE is doing it with their MITRE ATLAS\\nframework. And the framework integrates their existing\\nMITRE attack for enterprise framework that shows that\\nthey bring in that consistency and interoperability across\\ncybersecurity efforts as it pertains to AI systems. And\\nthat\\'s MITRE ATLAS threat model.\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 8\\nJon: 12:01 Terrifically useful context there from Gina. In my next\\nclip, Alex Andorra and I discuss Bayesian statistics,\\nnamely why being able to crunch larger and larger data\\nsets has helped us to use a powerful modeling technique\\nthat was originally devised centuries ago.\\n12:15 In addition to the podcast, also, I mentioned this at the\\noutset, I said that you\\'re co-founder and principal data\\nscientist of the popular Bayesian stats modeling platform,\\nPyMC. So like many things in data science, it\\'s uppercase\\nP, lowercase Y, for Python. What\\'s the MC? PyMC, one\\nword, M and the C are capitalized.\\nAlex: 12:38 So it\\'s very confusing because it stands for Python and\\nthen MC is Monte Carlo. So I understand, but why Monte\\nCarlo? It\\'s because it comes from Markov chain Monte\\nCarlo. So actually, it should be PyMCMC or PyMC\\nsquared, which is what I\\'m saying since the beginning.\\nBut anyways, yeah, it\\'s actually PyMC squared. So for\\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo\\nis one of the main ways... All the algorithms now, new\\nones, but the blockbuster algorithm to run Bayesian\\nmodels is to use MCMC.\\nJon: 13:21 So in the same way that stochastic gradient descent is\\nlike the defacto standard for finding your model weights\\nin machine learning, Markov chain Monte Carlo is the\\nstandard way of doing it with the Bayesian network?\\nAlex: 13:36 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And so now there are newer versions,\\nmore efficient versions. That\\'s basically the name of the\\ngame, making the algorithm more and more efficient. But\\nthe first algorithm dates back... I think it was actually\\ninvented during the project Manhattan. So during World\\nWar II.\\nJon: 13:57 Theme of the day.\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 9\\nAlex: 13:58 Yeah. And lots of physicists actually, statistical physics is\\na field that\\'s contributed a lot to MCMC. And so yeah,\\nphysicists who came to the field of statistics and trying to\\nmake the algorithms more efficient for their models. So\\nthey have contributed a lot. The field of physics has\\ncontributed a lot of big names and people to great leaps\\ninto the realm of more efficient algorithms. And so, I don\\'t\\nknow who your audience is, but that may sound boring.\\n14:37 Yeah, the algorithm, it\\'s like the workhorse, but it\\'s\\nextremely powerful. And that\\'s also one of the main\\nreasons why Bayesian statistics are increasing in\\npopularity lately, because I\\'m going to argue that it\\'s\\nalways been the best framework to do statistics, to do\\nscience. But it was hard to do with pen and paper\\nbecause the problem is that you have a huge, nasty\\nintegral on the numerator, on the denominator, sorry.\\nAnd this integral is not computable by pen and paper. So\\nfor a long, long time, Bayesian statistics combined two\\nfeatures like campaigns, PR campaigns. Bayesian\\nstatistics was relegated to the margins because it was just\\nsuper hard to do.\\n15:31 And so for other problems, other than very trivial ones, it\\nwas not very applicable. But now with the advent of\\npersonal computing, you have these incredible\\nalgorithms. So now most of the time, it\\'s HMC, Hamilton\\nand Monte Carlo. That\\'s what we use under the hood with\\nPyMC. But if you stand, if you use [inaudible 00:15:54] ,\\nit\\'s the same. And thanks to these algorithms, now we\\ncan make extremely powerful models because we can\\napproximate the [inaudible 00:16:03] distributions thanks\\nto, well, computer\\'s computing power. A computer is very\\ngood at computing. I think that\\'s why it\\'s called that.\\nJon: 16:15 Yes. And so that reminds me of deep learning. It\\'s a\\nsimilar kind of thing where the applications we have\\ntoday, like your ChatGPT or whatever your favorite large\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 10\\nlanguage model is, these amazing. Video generation like\\nSora, all of this is happening thanks to deep learning,\\nwhich is an approach we\\'ve had since the \\'50s. Certainly\\nnot as old as Bayesian statistics, but similarly, it has\\nbeen able to take off with much larger data sets and\\nmuch more compute.\\nAlex: 16:46 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, very good point. And I think\\nthat\\'s even more the point in deep learning for sure,\\nbecause Bayesian stats doesn\\'t need the scale, but the\\nway we\\'re doing deep learning for now, definitely need the\\nscale.\\nJon: 16:58 Yeah, yeah. Scale of data.\\nAlex: 17:00 Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, sorry, yeah, the scale, because\\nour two scales, data and computing. Yeah. You\\'re right.\\nJon: 17:05 And for model parameters. So that has actually... I mean,\\ntying back to something you said near the beginning of\\nthis episode, is that actually one of the advantages of\\nBayesian statistics is that you can do it with very few\\ndata. Maybe fewer data than with a frequentist approach\\nor a machine learning approach, because you can bake in\\nyour prior assumptions. And those prior assumptions\\ngive some kind of structure, some kind of framework for\\nyour data to make an impact.\\nAlex: 17:32 Yeah. Yeah, completely.\\nJon: 17:34 And in keeping with the theme of returning to the past to\\nfind golden opportunities, I speak to Dr. Nathan Lambert\\nabout historical influences on contemporary\\nmethodologies. I also managed to sneak in a question\\nabout reinforcement learning from human feedback.\\nNathan is a research scientist for the Allen Institute for\\nAI, and previously built out the RLHF team at Hugging\\nFace. So there was no better person to ask about the lack\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 11\\nof robustness in RLHF and how that could impact the\\nfuture development and deployment of AI systems.\\n18:02 Another really cool thing that you\\'ve done related to RLHF\\nis you have traced it back to ancient philosophy and\\nmodern economics. So mentioning Aristotle and von\\nNeumann-Morganstern utility theorem, for example. I\\ndon\\'t really know what the VNM utility theorem is, but\\nhow do these historical foundations influence current\\nmethodologies and what can modern AI research learn\\nfrom these early theories?\\nNathan: 18:30 Yeah. So this is a fun paper with a few colleagues that I\\nstarted working with at Berkeley, and now we\\'re kind of\\nspread out. This is all based on the fact that RL is very\\ndeep field multidisciplinary history, where it goes way\\nback. And then the notion of preference is a very vague\\nthing in economics. And it\\'s like the von NeumannMorganstern theory is a foundational thing that\\nessentially it\\'s like you can express either all behaviors or\\nall goals as probability and expected value distributions,\\nwhich essentially lets you do expected value math over\\npreferences.\\n19:10 And then it led to a bunch of debates on whether or not\\npreferences actually exist and are tractable in any of\\nthese things, or if they\\'re actually measurable or not due\\nto the preference shift over time based on context. So\\nthese are the kinds of things that we take and it\\'s ask a\\nlot of questions on how this impacts the modern RLHF\\nprocess. It\\'s things like is the final model\\'s preferences,\\nwhich is like we\\'re mapping onto very human terms, is\\nthat actually based more on the the base model, which is\\nscraped from the internet than the human preferences\\nthat they get from somewhere like Scale AI.\\n19:46 So it\\'s like if it\\'s based more on the internet crawling than\\nthis million dollar dataset they\\'re getting from Scale AI,\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 12\\nit\\'s kind of confusing to the marketing where we\\'re saying\\nwe\\'re learning a preference model, but it might not\\nactually do that much. Is other things like OpenAI now\\nhas a ton of user data and it\\'s like what does the\\neconomics literature say about generating data for\\ntraining that comes from a user context or a professional\\ncontext where someone is paid to do it and they\\'re paid to\\nact in a certain way? And how does all of this mix? So it\\'s\\nreally just a super long list of questions of why we should\\nlook at other social sciences if we\\'re making grand claims\\nabout human preferences and all of these things.\\nJon: 20:26 Nice. Well, fascinating. Tons to dig into there for our\\nlisteners. Final topic that I planned related to RLHF, I\\'m\\nsure it\\'ll come up again organically in the conversation,\\nbut you\\'ve mentioned that RLHF is not even robust to\\nfine-tuning. And so removing the safety layer from models\\nlike GPT-4 and Llama 2 can break down the notion of\\nsafety. Can you elaborate on the implications of this\\nfragility for the future development and deployment of AI\\nsystems?\\nNathan: 20:59 Yeah, so this is a specific line of research. So there\\'s a few\\npapers that showed that if you take a model like Zephyr\\nor Tulu that we were mentioning, if they have safety in\\nthe dataset, if you then go and fine-tune it again on some\\ndifferent tasks, you\\'ll do some of the behaviors that are\\n\"ingrained\" in the model. I honestly think this is a little\\nbit more clickbaity than actually worrisome because it\\'s\\nreally not surprising given that if you just look at the\\namount of compute applied at fine-tuning, we pre-trained\\nthese models for trillions of tokens. And then we apply a\\ncouple billion tokens of compute at fine-tuning.\\n21:36 And it\\'s like we\\'re not changing the weights of the model\\nsubstantially. We\\'re doing a slight nudge, and it makes\\nsense that a slight nudge could be undone at the same\\nway. But if you were to take this to some of the bigger\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 13\\nlabs, what you hear is that safety is not just a single\\nartifact thing. Safety is much more about a complete\\nsystem than a model. So open weight models being\\nunsafe or unsafe, I don\\'t consider to be that big of a deal.\\nIt\\'s like if you were to apply them to a free endpoint that\\neveryone on the internet could talk to, then I don\\'t want\\nmy model saying good things about Hitler and all these\\nobvious things.\\n22:09 But if it\\'s a research artifact that you need to spin up\\nGPUs to use yourself, and it\\'s a little bit more... I\\'m more\\nopen to having these diversity of models exist. But if you\\nask [inaudible 00:22:22] or somebody, it\\'s like, \"What\\nhappens... How do you get safety into your model?\" And\\nit\\'s like, it\\'s not just RLHF. You need to have safety at the\\npre-training, any preference model you trained. And then\\nall of these models have a safety filter on the output. So\\nChatGPT, it reads all the text generated from the base\\nmodel, and then there\\'s a go, no go where it will rephrase\\nthe text if it gets a no-go signal, which is like their content\\nmoderation API.\\n22:45 So it\\'s kind of a double. It\\'s the type of thing where\\nresearchers need to market their work, but it\\'s not as big\\nof a detail as I think it is. It\\'s like, okay, I think it has\\ninteresting business downstream things with liability. So\\nit\\'s just like if you want to fine-tune a Llama model, you\\nnormally do that on your own hardware, but OpenAI has\\na fine-tuning API. And if they claim their model is safe,\\nbut any fine-tuning on their API that they then host\\nmakes it unsafe, that seems like more of a business\\nproblem. Which is like, oh, it\\'s a nice way that open\\necosystem might be better off because it breaks the\\nliability chain. But we\\'ll see this research continue to\\nevolve. It\\'s so early in all of these things for a year in.\\nJon: 23:31 All right. That\\'s it for today\\'s In Case You Missed It\\nepisode, to be sure not to miss any of our exciting\\nShow Notes: http://www.superdatascience.com/802 14\\nupcoming episodes. Be sure to subscribe to this podcast\\nif you haven\\'t already. But most importantly, I hope you\\'ll\\njust keep on listening. Until next time, keep on rocking it\\nout there.

This article focuses on auto-regressive models, but these methods are applicable to other architectures and tasks as well.\\n     \\n\\nThis is the first article in the series. In it, we present explorables and visualizations aiding the intuition of:\\n\\n\\nInput Saliency methods that score input tokens importance to generating a token.\\n    \\n\\nNeuron Activations and how individual and groups of model neurons spike in response to\\n        inputs and to produce outputs.\\n    \\n\\nThe next article addresses Hidden State Evolution across the layers of the model and what it may tell us about each layer\\'s role.\\n\\n\\nIn the language of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) literature like Molnar et al., input saliency is a method that explains individual predictions. The latter two methods fall under the\\n    umbrella of \"analyzing components of more complex models\", and are better described as increasing the transparency  of transformer models.\\n\\nMoreover, this article is accompanied by reproducible notebooks and Ecco - an open source library to create similar\\n    interactive interfaces directly in Jupyter notebooks\\n    for GPT-based models from the HuggingFace transformers library.\\n\\nIf we\\'re to impose the three components we\\'re examining to explore the architecture of the transformer, it would look like the following figure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Figure: Three methods to gain a little more insight into the inner-workings of Transformer language models.\\n         \\n        By introducing tools that visualize input saliency, the evolution of hidden states, and neuron activations, we aim to enable researchers to build more intuition about Transformer language models.\\n    \\n\\n\\nInput Saliency\\nWhen a computer vision model classifies a picture as containing a husky, saliency maps can tell us whether the classification was made due to the visual properties of the animal itself, or because of the snow in the background. This is a method of attribution explaining the relationship between a model\\'s output and inputs -- helping us detect errors and biases, and better understand the behavior of the system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Figure: Input saliency map attributing a model\\'s prediction to input pixels.\\n         \\n\\n\\nMultiple methods exist for assigning importance scores to the inputs of an NLP model. The literature is most often concerned with this application for classification tasks, rather than natural\\n    language generation. This article focuses on language generation. Our first interface calculates feature importance after each token is generated, and by\\n    hovering or tapping on an output token, imposes a saliency map on the tokens responsible for generating it.\\n\\n\\n    The first example for this interface asks GPT2-XL for William Shakespeare\\'s date of birth. The model is correctly able to produce the date (1564, but broken into two tokens: \" 15\" and \"64\", because the model\\'s vocabulary does not include \" 1564\" as a single token). The interface shows the importance of each input token when generating each output token:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Input saliency of Shakespeare\\'s birth\\n            year using Gradient × Input.\\nTap or hover over the output tokens.\\n        GPT2-XL is able to tell the birth date of William Shakespeare expressed in two tokens. In generating the\\n        first token, 53% of the importance is assigned to the name (20% to the first name, 33% to the last name).\\n        The next most important two tokens are \" year\" (22%) and \" born\" (14%). In generating the second token to\\n        complete the date, the name still is the most important with 60% importance, followed by the first portion\\n        of the date -- a model output, but an input to the second time step. \\n        This prompt aims to probe world knowledge. It was generated using greedy decoding. Smaller variants of GPT2\\n        were not able to output the correct date.\\n    \\n\\nOur second example attempts to both probe a model\\'s world knowledge, as well as to see if the model\\n    repeats the patterns in the text (simple patterns like the periods after numbers and like new lines, and\\n    slightly more involved patterns like completing a numbered list). The model used here is DistilGPT2.\\n\\nThis explorable shows a more detailed view that displays the attribution percentage for each token -- in case you need that precision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Input saliency of a list of EU countries \\nTap or hover over the output tokens.\\n        This was generated by DistilGPT2 and attribution via Gradients X Inputs. Output sequence is cherry-picked to\\n        only include European countries and uses sampled (non-greedy) decoding. Some model runs would include China,\\n        Mexico, and other countries in the list. With the exception of the repeated \" Finland\", the model continues\\n        the list alphabetically.\\n\\n    \\n\\nAnother example that we use illustratively in the rest of this article is one where we ask the model to complete\\n    a simple pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Input saliency of a simple\\n            alternating pattern of commas and the number one.\\nTap or hover over the output tokens.\\n        Every generated token ascribes the first token in the input the highest feature importance score. Then\\n        throughout the sequence, the preceding token, and the first three tokens in the sequence are often the most\\n        important. This uses Gradient × Inputs on GPT2-XL. \\n        This prompt aims to probe the model\\'s response to syntax and token patterns. Later in the article, we build\\n        on it by switching to counting instead of repeating the digit \\' 1\\'. Completion gained using greedy decoding.\\n        DistilGPT2 is able to complete it correctly as well.\\n    \\n\\nIt is also possible to use the interface to analyze the responses of a transformer-based conversational agent.\\n    In the following example, we pose an existential question to DiabloGPT:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Input saliency of DiabloGPT\\'s answer to the ultimate question \\nTap or hover over the output tokens.\\n        This was the model\\'s first response to the prompt. The question mark is attributed the highest score in the\\n        beginning of the output sequence. Generating the tokens \" will\" and \" ever\" assigns noticeably more importance to\\n        the word \" ultimate\".\\n        This uses Gradient × Inputs on DiabloGPT-large.\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Gradient-Based Saliency\\nDemonstrated above is scoring feature importance based on Gradients X Inputs-- a gradient-based saliency method shown by Atanasova et al.\\n    to perform well across various datasets for text classification in transformer models.\\n\\nTo illustrate how that works, let\\'s\\n    first recall how the model generates the output token in each time step. In the following figure, we see how\\n    ①\\n    the\\n    language model\\'s final hidden state is projected into the model\\'s vocabulary resulting in a numeric score for\\n    each\\n    token in the model\\'s vocabulary. Passing that scores vector through a softmax operation results in a probability\\n    score for each token. ② We proceed to select a token\\n    (e.g. select the highest-probability scoring token, or sample from the top scoring tokens) based\\n    on\\n    that vector.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Figure: Gradient-based input saliency\\n        \\n\\n\\n③ By calculating the gradient of the\\n    selected logit (before the softmax) with respect to the inputs by back-propagating it all the way back to the\\n    input tokens, we get a signal of how important each token was in the calculation resulting in this generated\\n    token.\\n    That assumption is based on the idea that the smallest change in the input token with the highest\\n    feature-importance\\n    value makes a large change in what the resulting output of the model would be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Figure: Gradient X input calculation and aggregation\\n        \\n\\n\\nThe resulting gradient vector per token is then multiplied by the input embedding of the respective token. Taking\\n    the L2 norm of the resulting vector results in the token\\'s feature importance score. We then normalize the\\n    scores by dividing by the sum of these scores.\\nMore formally, gradient × input is described as follows:\\n\\n∥∇Xifc(X1:n)Xi∥2 \\\\lVert \\\\nabla _{X_i} f_c (X_{1:n})  X_i\\\\lVert_2∥∇Xi\\u200b\\u200bfc\\u200b(X1:n\\u200b)Xi\\u200b∥2\\u200b\\n\\n\\n    Where  is the embedding vector of the input token at timestep i, and  is the back-propagated gradient of the score of the selected token unpacked as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n is the list of input token embedding vectors in the input sequence (of length\\n        )\\n    \\n\\n is the score of the selected token after a forward pass through the model (selected through any one of a number of methods including greedy/argmax decoding, sampling, or beam search).\\n        With the c standing for \"class\" given this is often described in the classification context. We\\'re keeping the notation even though in our case, \"token\" is more fitting.\\n    \\n\\n\\nThis formalization is the one stated by Bastings et al. except the gradient and input vectors are multiplied element-wise. The resulting vector is then aggregated into a score via calculating the L2 norm as this was empirically shown in Atanasova et al. to perform better than other methods (like averaging).\\n\\nNeuron Activations\\nThe Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) sublayer is one of the two major components inside a transformer block (in\\n    addition to self-attention). It accounts for 66% of the parameters of a transformer block and thus provides a\\n    significant portion of the model\\'s representational capacity. Previous work\\n    has examined neuron firings inside deep neural networks in both the NLP and computer vision domains. In this\\n    section we apply that examination to transformer-based language models.\\n\\nContinue Counting: 1, 2, 3, ___ \\nTo guide our neuron examination, let\\'s present our model with the input \"1, 2, 3\" in hopes it would echo the\\n    comma/number alteration, yet also keep incrementing the numbers.\\nIt succeeds.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy using the methods we\\'ll discuss in Article #2 (following the lead of nostalgebraist), we can produce a graphic that exposes the probabilities of output tokens after each layer in the model. This looks at the hidden state after each layer, and displays the ranking of the ultimately produced output token in that layer.\\nFor example, in the first step, the model produced the token \" 4\". The first column tells us about that process. The bottom most cell in that column shows that the token \" 4\" was ranked #1 in probability after the last layer. Meaning that the last layer (and thus the model) gave it the highest probability score. The cells above indicate the ranking of the token \" 4\" after each layer.\\nBy looking at the hidden states, we observe that the model gathers confidence\\n    about the two patterns of the\\n    output sequence (the commas, and the ascending numbers) at different layers.\\n\\n\\n\\n        The model is able to successfully complete the list. Examining the hidden states shows that the earlier\\n        layers of\\n        the model are more comfortable predicting the commas as that\\'s a simpler pattern. It is still able to\\n        increment\\n        the digits, but it needs at least one more layer to start to be sure about those outputs.\\n    \\n\\nWhat happens at Layer 4 which makes the model elevate the digits (4, 5, 6) to the top of the probability\\n    distribution?\\nWe can plot the activations of the neurons in layer 4 to get a sense of neuron activity. That is what the first of the following three figures shows.\\nIt is difficult, however, to gain any interpretation from looking at activations during one forward pass through the model.\\n\\n    The figures below show neuron activations while five tokens are generated (\\' 4 , 5 , 6\\'). To get around the\\n    sparsity of the firings, we may wish to cluster the firings, which is what the subsequent figure shows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActivations of 200 neurons (out of 3072) in Layer 4\\'s FFNN resulting in the model outputting the\\n                    token \\'\\xa04\\'\\n                Each row is a neuron. Only neurons with positive activation are colored. The darker they are, the more\\n                intense the firing.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeuron firings in the FFNN sublayer of Layer 4 \\n                    Each row corresponds to a neuron in the feedforward neural network of layer #4. Each column is\\n                    that neuron\\'s status when a token was generated (namely, the token at the top of the\\n                    figure).\\n                    A view of the first 400 neurons shows how sparse the activations usually are (out of the 3072\\n                    neurons in the FFNN layer in DistilGPT2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClustering Neurons by Activation Values\\n                    To locate the signal, the neurons are clustered (using kmeans on the activation values) to reveal the firing pattern. We notice:\\n                    \\nThe largest cluster or two tend to be sparse like the orange cluster.\\n                        \\nNeurons in the green cluster fire the\\n                            most when generating a number.\\n                        \\nNeurons in the red cluster, however,\\n                            fire the most when generating the commas.\\n                        \\nThe purple cluster tracks the digits,\\n                            but with less intensity and larger number of\\n                            neurons.\\n                        \\nNeurons in the pink cluster are focused\\n                            on the numbers and rarely fire when generating\\n                            the\\n                            commas. Their activations\\n                            get higher and higher the more the token value is incremented.\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    If visualized and examined properly, neuron firings can reveal the complementary and compositional roles that can be played by individual neurons, and groups of neurons.\\n\\nEven after clustering, looking directly at activations is a crude and noisy affair. As presented in\\n    Olah et al.,\\n    we are better off reducing the dimensionality using a matrix decomposition method. We follow the authors\\'\\n    suggestion to use Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a natural candidate for reducing the dimensionality\\n    into groups that are potentially individually more interpretable. Our first experiments were with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), but NMF\\n    is a better approach because it\\'s difficult to interpret the negative values in a PCA component of neuron\\n    firings.\\n\\nFactor Analysis\\nBy first capturing the activations of the neurons in FFNN layers of the model, and then decomposing them into a\\n    more manageable number of factors (using) using NMF, we are able to shed light on how various neurons contributed towards each generated token.\\n\\nThe simplest approach is to break down the activations into two factors. In our next interface, we have the model\\n    generate thirty tokens, decompose the activations into two factors, and highlight each token with the factor\\n    with the highest activation when that token was generated:\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Two Activation Factors of a Counting Sequence \\nTap or hover over the sparklines on the left to isolate a certain\\n        factor \\nFactor #1 contains the collection of neurons\\n        that\\n        light up to produce a number. It is a linear transformation of 5,449 neurons (30% of the 18,432 neurons in\\n        the FFNN layers: 3072 per layer, 6 layers in DistilGPT2). \\nFactor #2 contains the collection of neurons\\n        that light up to produce a comma. It is a linear transformation of 8,542 neurons (46% of the FFNN neurons).\\n        \\n        The two factors have 4,365 neurons in common. \\n Note: The association between the color and the token is different in the case of the input tokens and\\n        output tokens. For the input tokens, this is how the neurons fired in response to the token as an\\n        input. For the output tokens, this is the activation value which produced the token. This is why the\\n        last input token and the first output token share the same activation value.\\n    \\n\\nThis interface is capable of compressing a lot of data that showcase the excitement levels of factors composed of\\n    groups of neurons. The sparklines\\n    on the left give a snapshot of the excitement level of each factor across the entire sequence. Interacting with\\n    the sparklines (by hovering with a mouse or tapping on touchscreens) displays the activation of the factor on\\n    the tokens in the sequence on the right.\\n\\nWe can see that decomposing activations into two factors resulted in factors that correspond with the alternating\\n    patterns we\\'re analyzing (commas, and incremented numbers). We can increase the resolution of the factor\\n    analysis by increasing the number of factors. The following figure decomposes the same activations into five\\n    factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Five Activation Factors of a Counting Sequence \\nTap or hover over the sparklines on the left to isolate a certain\\n        factor \\n\\nDecomposition into five factors shows the counting factor being broken down into three factors, each\\n                addressing a distinct portion of the sequence (start, middle, end).\\n            \\nThe yellow factor reliably tracks\\n                generating the commas in the sequence.\\n            \\nThe blue factor is common across\\n                various GPT2 factors -- it is of neurons that intently focus on the first token in the sequence, and\\n                only on that token.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nWe can start extending this to input sequences with more content, like the list of EU countries:\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Six Activation Factors of a list of EU countries \\nTap or hover over the sparklines on the left to isolate a certain\\n        factor \\n\\n\\nAnother example, of how DistilGPT2 reacts to XML, shows a clear distinction of factors attending to different\\n    components of the syntax. This time we are breaking down the activations into ten components: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Ten Activation Factors of XML \\nTap or hover over the sparklines on the left to isolate a certain\\n        factor \\n        Factorizing neuron activations in response to XML (that was generated by an RNN from\\n        ) into ten\\n        factors\\n        results in factors corresponding to:\\n        \\n New-lines\\nLabels of tags, with higher activation on\\n                closing tags\\n            \\nIndentation spaces\\nThe \\'<\\' (less-than) character\\n                starting XML tags\\n            \\nThe large factor focusing on the first token. Common to GPT2 models.\\n            \\nTwo factors tracking the \\'>\\' (greater than) character at the end of XML\\n                tags\\n            \\nThe text inside XML tags\\nThe \\'</\\' symbols indicating\\n                closing XML tag\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nFactorizing Activations of a Single Layer\\nThis interface is a good companion for hidden state examinations which can highlight a specific layer of\\n    interest, and using this interface we can focus our analysis on that layer of interest. It is straight-forward\\n    to apply this method to specific layers of interest. Hidden-state evolution diagrams, for example,\\n    indicate that layer #0 does a lot of heavy lifting as it often tends to shortlist the tokens that make it to the\\n    top of the probability distribution. The following figure showcases ten factors applied to the activations\\n    of layer 0 in response to a passage by Fyodor Dostoyevsky:\\n\\n\\n\\nExplorable: Ten Factors From The Underground \\nTap or hover over the sparklines on the left to isolate a certain\\n        factor \\n        Ten Factors from the activations the neurons in Layer 0 in response to a passage from Notes from Underground\\n        by Dostoevsky.\\n        \\nFactors that focus on specific portions of the text (beginning, middle, and end. This is interesting as the only signal\\n                the model gets about how these tokens are connected are the positional encodings. This indicates the\\n                neurons that are keeping track of the order of words. Further examination is required to assess\\n                whether these FFNN neurons directly respond to the time signal, or if they are responding to a\\n                specific trigger in the self-attention layer\\'s transformation of the hidden state.\\n            \\n\\n                Factors corresponding to linguistic features, for example, we can see factors for pronouns (he, him), auxiliary verbs (would, will), other verbs (introduce, prove -- notice the\\n                understandable misfiring at the \\'suffer\\' token which is a partial token of \\'sufferings\\', a noun),\\n                linking verbs (is, are, were), and a factor\\n                that favors nouns and their adjectives\\n                (\"fatal rubbish\", \"vulgar folly\").\\n            \\nA factor corresponding to commas, a\\n                syntactic feature.\\n            \\nThe first-token factor\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can crank up the resolution by increasing the number of factors. Increasing this to eighteen factors\\n    starts to\\n    reveal factors that light up in response to adverbs, and other factors that light up in response to partial\\n    tokens. Increase the number of factors more and you\\'ll start to identify factors that light up in response\\n    to\\n    specific words (\"nothing\" and \"man\" seem especially provocative to the layer).\\nAbout Activation Factor Analysis\\nThe explorables above show the factors resulting from decomposing the matrix holding the activations values of FFNN neurons using Non-negative Matrix Factorization. The following figure sheds light on how that is done:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Figure: Decomposition of activations matrix using NMF.\\n         \\n        NMF reveals patterns of neuron activations inside one or a collection of layers.\\n    \\n\\nBeyond dimensionality reduction, Non-negative Matrix Factorization can reveal underlying common behaviour of groups of neurons. It can be used to analyze the entire network, a single layer, or groups of layers.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis concludes the first article in the series.

       "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models. It was launched on March 14, 2023, and made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, via OpenAI's API, and via the free chatbot Microsoft Copilot.  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.: 2 \n",
       "Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions. GPT-4, equipped with vision capabilities (GPT-4V), is capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT. OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.\n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\" It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books. The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with over 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples. GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.\n",
       "Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams. It can now interact with users through spoken words and respond to images, allowing for more natural conversations and the ability to provide suggestions or answers based on photo uploads.\n",
       "To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.\n",
       "When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces. For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.\n",
       "A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to "
